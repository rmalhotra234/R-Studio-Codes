# R-Studio-Codes
This repo is meant to serve as an intro guide to R Studio and Data Analysis and cleaning techniques. 
My name is Rishi and I graduated with a BS in Economics and am currently working on my MS in Data Analytics.

I have never been a coder. I tried learning Java, HTML, and other languages when I was young, but nothing ever stuck. R Studio was something I was introduced in my senior year of college as I worked through Econometrics and my Applied Capstone. R Studio can be a lot to handle, but it is also very powerful. As I get farther and farther in my Data Analytics journey, I wanted to start this repo to document the codes I find and use in my process. It isn't meant to be the end all be all, but hopefully will grow into a great resource I can show others along my journey.
